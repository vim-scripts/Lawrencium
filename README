Lawrencium is a Mercurial wrapper for Vim, inspired by Tim Pope's Fugitive. It adds many commands like :Hg (run a Mercurial command with auto-completion), :Hgedit (open a file relative to the repository's root), :Hgdiff and :Hgcommit (you can easily guess what they do), and a very cool :Hgstatus which shows an interactive version of `hg status`'s output.

See the project's README file for more information: https://bitbucket.org/ludovicchabant/vim-lawrencium/overview
