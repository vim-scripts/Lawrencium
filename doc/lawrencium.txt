1.  Introduction                                *lawrencium-intro*

When a file from a Mercurial repository is open in a buffer, that buffer gets
new commands defined.

This plugin is only available if 'compatible' is not set.

2.  Commands                                    *lawrencium-commands*

All commands defined by |lawrencium| are local to each buffer.

                                                *:Hg*
:Hg {args}              Run an arbitrary Mercurial command. Similar to :!hg
                        [args] but the '--repository' is automatically
                        specified with the root of the repository the current
                        file belongs to, and it will auto-complete any
                        standard command or option.

                                                *:Hg!*
:Hg! {args}             Like |:Hg|, but the output of the command is placed in
                        a temp file and edited in the |preview-window|.

                                                *:Hgcd*
:Hgcd[!] {path}         |:cd| relative to the root of the repository.

                                                *:Hglcd*
:Hglcd[!] {path}        |:lcd| relative to the root of the repository.

                                                *:Hgedit*
:Hgedit {file}          |:edit| {file} relative to the root of the repository.

                                                *:Hgedit!*
:Hgedit! {file}         |:edit!| {file} relative to the root of the repository.

                                                *:Hgstatus*
:Hgstatus               Shows the output of 'hg status' in the
                        |preview-window|. Some extra-commands, along with some
                        default mappins, are available in this window. See
                        |lawrencium-status-window|.

                                                *:Hgdiff*
:Hgdiff                 Diffs the current file against its parent revision.

                                                *:Hgdiff_f*
:Hgdiff {revspec}       Diffs the current file against the specified revision.

                                                *:Hgvdiff*
:Hgvdiff                Same as |:Hgdiff| but uses a vertical split.

                                                *:Hgvdiff_f*
:Hgvdiff {revspec}      Same as |:Hgdiff_f| but uses a vertical split.

                                                *:Hgcommit*
:Hgcommit               Opens a new window to edit a commit message into a
                        temporary file and, upon quitting the buffer, if that
                        file has been written to, commit the current changes
                        to the repository.

                                                *:Hgvcommit*

                        the commit message.

:Hgrevert {files}                               *:Hgrevert*
                        Reverts the given files (in repo-relative paths). If no
                        file are given, reverts the current file.

:Hgrevert! {files}                              *:Hgrevert!*
                        Same as |:Hgrevert| but with the --no-backup option
                        given to prevent a .orig backup file from being
                        created.

3.  Status Window                               *lawrencium-status-window*

The `hg status` window opened by Lawrencium has a few special commands 
defined in it. Also, unless the global `lawrencium_define_mappings` is set to
`0`, some commands are mapped to keyboard shortcuts, as detailed in the
following descriptions.


                                                *:Hgstatusedit*
:Hgstatusedit           Open the file mentioned on the current line.
                        Mapped to <cr>.

                                                *:Hgstatusaddremove*
:Hgstatusaddremove      Run `hg addremove` on the file mentioned on the
                        current line, or on the lines currently selected in
                        visual selection mode (see |visual-start|).
                        Mapped to <C-A>.

                                                *:Hgstatusdiff*
:Hgstatusdiff           Open a diff window on the file mentioned on the
                        current line, between the working directory version
                        and the parent revision version. Similar to running
                        |:Hgdiff| on that file.
                        Mapped to <C-D>.

                                                *:Hgstatusvdiff*
:Hgstatusvdiff          Similar to |:Hgstatusdiff|, but use a vertical split.
                        Similar to running |:Hgvdiff| on that file.
                        Mapped to <C-V>.

                                                *:Hgstatuscommit*
:Hgstatuscommit         Runs |:Hgcommit| on the files currently mentioned in
                        the buffer, or in the current selection. The first 
                        option means you can delete lines from the buffer
                        until the remaining filenames are those you want to
                        commit.
                        Mapped to <C-S>.

                                                *:Hgstatusvcommit*
:Hgstatusvcommit        Similar to |:Hgstatuscommit|, but use a vertical
                        split, as with |:Hgvcommit|.
                        Not mapped byd default.

                                                *:Hgstatusrefresh*
:Hgstatusrefresh        Refreshes the status window by running `hg status`
                        again.
                        Mapped to <C-R>.

                                                *lawrencium-status-mappings*
A few other mappings are available in the status window:

   <C-N>                Jump to the next filename.
   <C-P>                Jump to the previous filename.
   q                    Quit the status window.
